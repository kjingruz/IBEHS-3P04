# IBEHS-3P04-Project

This is the work I have completed for IBEHS 3P04

The P0 folder consists of project 0 which is an introductory project that we worked on at the beginning of the school term. 

The rest of the files in the Arduino and the Python folder are the files for the main project.

The main project is a rehabilitation aid that targets non-specific neck pain. 
For us, we are using BNO55 sensor and ESP32 microcontroller to measure the head tilt angles and back muscle angles
to determine if there are harmful postures from the user. There would be notification that will be alerting the user 
when such posture is found. The project is aimed to facilitate the communication between arduino, python and cell phone/computer
using Bluetooth and graphical user interface.
